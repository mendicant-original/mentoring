Often students can feel stuck or overwhelmed; perhaps they've bitten off more than they can chew. On the other hand, students can be found obsessing about a minor part of the project, avoiding the main implementation. Many of developers have been in this situation before. If you find a student in this situation, encourage them to reassess their project, narrow the scope, and prioritize individual pieces of code. Sometimes this can go a lot further than doing a code review itself.

Avoid trying to solve the problem for the student, it won't do them any good. And if you're mentoring multiple students, you won't have the time to do it anyway.

## Closing Thoughts

There's a secret to Mentoring that you don't often hear. You are going to learn as much, from your mentees as they are from you. You are going to be tackling all kinds of code of various styles, strength and weaknesses. Unless you've worked on substantial projects before, this is an experience you've never had.

Don't feel discouraged if after writing a detailed treatise on why a students code should be refactored and how, they respond with, "no I did it this way because it's..." If you've made your argument and they reject it, at least you've tried. In the same vein, if you write something and the instructor comes back going, "well actually" (or "no, that's bullshit"), don't worry about it. Both you and the student will gain a better understanding after the instructors explanation, and you have something new to share the next time the same question comes around (and if you are mentoring more than one session, you'll see it come up again).

Overall, if work hard and keep up on your communication channels you'll have a great experience mentoring at RbMU. You'll be helping programmers who are in the same position you once were, and will take away valuable knowledge that you can use elsewhere in your life.
