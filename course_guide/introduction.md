Thank you for volunteering to be a mentor for our Core Skills Course. There's a lot of work ahead for you; and just as when you took the Core Skills course yourself, you'll get out what you put in. The first thing to remember is to treat the mentees with respect. They are your peers and future fellow alumni. Remember how difficult and challenging the core course was when you took? Make sure you help the students, not hinder them.

## Course Overview

Your role as a mentor will be to help review students code, engage in discussions and most importantly provide them with help and encouragement. You'll be doing this using the RbMU infrastructure which is described later in this guide.

The course is punctuated by two project proposal checkpoints and three formal checkpoints. While you are not required to review the project proposals ahead of the start of the course, feel free to examine the students proposals and discuss them with the students.

During the first week of the course students might not feel comfortable asking for reviews. To help them over this hurdle, find out which exercises they're working on and offer to review their progress ahead of the instructor (or their assistant) providing a formal review.

After the first checkpoint, you will be assigned to lead a review group. While you can still help other students, these are the ones that you should focus your attention on first. Try and proactively look at your groups projects and assignments and provide them with reviews and help where you can. During these final two weeks, you'll be giving detailed reviews; focusing on best practices, ruby idioms and style.
