## If you're looking to sign up for mentoring, this is the place

To sign up for a mentoring session, **[read these instructions first](https://github.com/rmu/mentoring/wiki/Instructions-for-students)**, and make sure that what you need help with meets our criteria.

Then head on over to the **[Issues log](https://github.com/rmu/mentoring/issues)** to request a session.  You should hear back from a mentor soon about your request and to arrange a meeting time.

**After your session, please give us some feedback about how it went.** This is really essential to improving the program.  Your mentor will write up a summary of your session on the wiki. You can add your comments to this page, or if you prefer to be anonymous [you can fill out a survey](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&authkey=CIjX4vsL&formkey=dDJIOHc2dmZaTWRPQVFpaXJiaV9BVlE6MQ#gid=0).

Questions?  Try the **[FAQ](https://github.com/rmu/mentoring/wiki/FAQ)** or other pages on the **[wiki](https://github.com/rmu/mentoring/wiki/Home)**. Or ask on the **#rmu irc channel on freenode**, or **[shoot us an email](mailto:rmu.mentoring@gmail.com)**.
